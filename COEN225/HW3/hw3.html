<pre>PROBLEM 1: Fixing Heap Memory Errors

Given the following program
<a href="https://www.engr.scu.edu/~slam3/coen225/uaf.c">
uaf.c
</a>
It has an use-after-free error and a multiple free error.
Fix the errors, perhaps with the help of Valgrind.
Add some comment in the file uaf.c describing the errors.

Submit the fixed C program uaf.c as an attachment to the email.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 2 : Fixing Valgrind reported errors in 10 small C++ programs.

BTW, Valgrind has been installed on the COEN lab machines as well as the Virtualbox VM.

Given the following archive/.tar file, which contains 10 C++ programs:
<a href="https://www.engr.scu.edu/~slam3/coen225/ValgrindHW.tar">
Valgrind.tar
</a>
Unpack the archive by:

$ tar xvf Valgrind.tar

to look at the 10 programs.
Compile them one at a time using g++ like:

$ g++ -g exp1.cc

and run the executables by:

$ valgrind ./a.out

Per file, observe the errors and fix them, and add comments in the file describing the errors and fixes.
If Valgrind does not report any errors, inspect the program to see if the program has an error
and explain why Valgrind does/does not report any errors.

Submit the 10 C++ programs by attaching the 10 files as attachments to the email.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM 3 (extra credit, a popular interview question) Linked List Deletion

Given the following linked list:

head             p
|                |
v                v
[data=1,next]-&gt;[data=2,next]-&gt;[data=3,next=NULL]

with the following definitions/declarations:

struct linkrecord {
  int data;
  struct linkrecord *next;
};
struct linkrecord *head;
struct linkrecord *p;

You are given pointer p, NOT pointer head, to call function delete() like:

delete(p);

Write the function delete resulting in the above list becoming:

[data=1,next]-&gt;[data=3,next=NULL]

void delete(struct linkerecord *p)
{
...
}

Submit the body of function delete in a file named problem3.c, attached to the email.

***Send one single email to slam3@scu.edu with attachments corresponding to the problems.
