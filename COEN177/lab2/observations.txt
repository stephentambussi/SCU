==========================
Step 3:
 - Without a command line argument when executing the program, the program has a segmentation fault.

Step 4:
 - With a delay of 500 microseconds, the program finishes executing very quickly (less than half a second).
 - With a delay of 5000 microseconds, the program takes longer to finish executing than with a delay of 500.

Step 6:
 - Like the process code, the thread program gives a seg fault without a command line argument.
