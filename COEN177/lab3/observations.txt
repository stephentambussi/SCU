Lab3 Observations
==========================
Step 1:
 - This program executes code that is the equivalent of the command line code: "ls | sort" using pipes for IPC.
 - "ls | sort" displays the contents of the current directory in alphanumeric order.

Step 2:
 - This program sends cmd line arguments from one process to another process for output using pipes.

Step 3:
 - This program sends the output of the "ls" command from one process to another for output using pipes. It is a modification of the program from step 2.

Step 4:
 - This program executes code that is the equivalent of the command line code: "cat /etc/passwd | grep root" using pipes for IPC.

Step 5:
 - This program is an example of the producer-consumer problem using pipes.
