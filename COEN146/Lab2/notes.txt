Processing time for system calls vs library functions
=====================================================
Lab computer testing:
- Copying large text file (Bible) of 3.9 MB was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.01s	system calls = 0.06s
- Copying large binary file of 977KB was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.00s	system calls = 0.01s
- Copying 10 binary files of varying sizes was the same speed
	functions = 0.01s	system calls = 0.01s
- Copying 10 text files of varying sizes was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.01s	system calls = 0.07s

Personal computer testing: Better accuracy
- Copying large text file (Bible) of 3.9 MB was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.071499s	system calls = 1.226491s
- Copying large binary file of 977KB was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.021957s	system calls = 0.283960s
- Copying 10 binary files of varying sizes was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.065381s	system calls = 0.673292s 
- Copying 10 text files of varying sizes was faster using library functions
	functions = 0.169314s	system calls = 2.193263s

Overall, library functions provide faster file IO than system calls
